This is an email spam filter. 
To tackle the spam classification problem, I used a supervised machine learning approach
using logistic regression as the core algorithm. To further compare the accuracy of the chosen
approach, I used two additional machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Random
Forest. Additionally, I implemented baseline models to evaluate the performance of our
approach and set benchmarks.
First, you run the predicte
